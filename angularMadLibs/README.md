# Angular Mad Libs

This **web app** renders a "mad libs" syle **game** that updates a story with text input by the user. The app's interactivity was created with **jQuery** and **AngularJS**. The "Reset" button uses jQuery, while the interactive text uses **AngularJS** to bind Angular's model directives onto HTML form fields.
